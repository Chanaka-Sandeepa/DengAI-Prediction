## DengAI-Prediction
### CS4622 - Final Report

## Introduction

DengAI is a data science competition hosted by Drivendata where competitors have to predict local epidemics of dengue fever. (https://www.drivendata.org/competitions/44/dengai-predicting-disease-spread/page/80/) 
Dengue fever is a mosquito-borne disease that occurs in tropical and subtropical parts of the world. Because it is carried by mosquitoes, the transmission dynamics of dengue are related to climate variables such as temperature and precipitation. Although the relationship to climate is complex, a growing number of scientists argue that climate change is likely to produce distributional shifts that will have significant public health implications worldwide.
Using environmental data collected by various U.S. Federal Government agencies—from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration in the U.S. Department of Commerce competitors are supposed to predict the number of dengue fever cases reported each week in San Juan, Puerto Rico and Iquitos, Perú based on environmental variables describing changes in temperature, precipitation, vegetation, and more.
